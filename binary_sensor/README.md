# Binary sensors

_Binary sensors are an easy to manage "trigger" sensors and can also represent device status as shown in the [Binary Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor/) Documentations_

Here is a summery of the sensors and their functionality

## Climate

- [Threshold](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/threshold/) sensor to configure desired temperature thresholds

## Jewish Calendar

- [Template](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor.template/) binary sensor to test whether it is fast today.
